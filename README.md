# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project, titled Car Price Prediction, is an end-to-end machine learning application aimed at predicting the selling price of used cars based on several input features. 
The dataset used in this project includes relevant information such as the car's brand, year of manufacture, fuel type, kilometers driven, transmission type, number of previous owners, and engine specifications. These features are essential in determining the resale value of a car in the secondary market. The project emphasizes the importance of transforming and encoding categorical data, handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and ensuring that the dataset is clean and ready for modeling.

This code explores the dataset thoroughly with descriptive statistics and visualizations that reveal patterns and correlations among variables. For instance, bar plots, histograms, and pair plots are used to understand how features like the number of years since purchase or fuel type impact car prices. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase is crucial in forming hypotheses and guiding feature engineering decisions.

Following EDA, the project implements multiple regression models to predict the car prices. Algorithms such as Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor are trained and evaluated using standard performance metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Hyperparameter tuning is performed where necessary to improve model performance, ensuring better generalization on unseen data.

This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook format, making it interactive and easy to follow. Users can clone the repository or download the notebook, install the necessary Python dependencies, and run the notebook in a local environment. The project can also be extended into a web-based application using Streamlit or Flask to provide a user-friendly interface for real-time car price prediction.
